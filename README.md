Homework 3- Password Generator

For this project, I used vanilla Javascript to create a random password generator that functions by the click of a button from the user's screen.

The purpose of this project is to create a random but secure password to ensure web security across webpages that require passwords. Without strong passwords, everyone would get hacked and all sensitive information would be compromised. 

This application promotes safe passwords that are difficult to guess, due to the random letters, numbers and special characters existing within.
